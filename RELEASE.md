# Releases

This page describes the release processes. It's inspired from
the [Prometheus release process](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/main/RELEASE.md)

## How to cut an individual release

### Branch management and versioning strategy

We use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

The current flow is to merge new features and bugfixes into the main branch.

As we are in early stage of the project, we don't intend to maintain previous version. Only the last version will be
patched if we estimate it requires an urgent patch that cannot wait for the next minor release.

### 0. Updating dependencies

We are using dependabot to keep up to date our dependencies (of Go or npm).

In case you would like to update manually the dependencies :

#### Updating Go dependencies

```bash
make update-go-deps
git add go.mod go.sum
git commit -m "Update Go dependencies"
```

### Updating npm dependencies

```bash
make update-npm-deps
git add ./ui/package-lock.json ./**/package.json
git commit -m "Update npm dependencies"
```

Note: in case you feel it, you can also upgrade the npm dependencies to their latest release (major or minor)
with `make upgrade-npm-deps`

### 1. Prepare your release

#### Create a release branch

Create a branch that follows the naming pattern `release/v<X.Y>` (no patch version!) and includes the changes you intend to release (usually the latest from `main`). Push it to Github. You will use this branch as the base in the next step.

> ⚠️ Release candidates and patch releases for any given major or minor release happen in the same `release/v<major>.<minor>` branch. Do not create `release/<version>` for patch or release candidate releases.

#### Create a PR with the changes

- Create a branch based on the release branch `release/v<X.Y>` you just created in the step above. This branch should use the naming pattern `<yourname>/release-v<major>.<minor>.<patch>`.
- Update the file `VERSION` with the new version to be created.
- Generate `CHANGELOG.md` updates based on git history:

  ```bash
  make generate-changelog
  ```
- Review the generated `CHANGELOG.md` for valid output. Things to check include:
  - Entries in the `CHANGELOG.md` are meant to be in this order:
    * `[FEATURE]`
    * `[ENHANCEMENT]`
    * `[BUGFIX]`
    * `[BREAKINGCHANGE]`
  - Entries that map to a pull request should include a pull request number.
  - As we have many libraries we publish, it's better if you also put a clear indication about what library is affected by
    these changes.
  - Consumers understand how to handle breaking changes either through the messaging in the changelog or through the linked pull requests.
- Update the `package.json` files for all packages with the corresponding version:

  ```bash
  make bump-version
  ```
- Push the branch to Github and create a pull request with the release branch as the base. This gives others the opportunity to chime in on the release,
  in general, and on the addition to the changelog, in particular.
  - It's also helpful to drop a link to the release PR in #perses-dev on Matrix to get extra visibility.
- Address any necessary feedback.
- Once the pull request is approved, merge it into the release branch.

### 2. Create release tag and validate release

- Pull down the latest updates to the release branch on your local machine to ensure you have the updates from the previous step.
- Tag the new release via the following commands:

  ```bash
  git checkout release/v<version_to_be_replaced>
  make tag
  git push origin v<version_to_be_replaced>
  ```

Signing a tag with a GPG key is appreciated, but in case you can't add a GPG key to your Github account using the
following [procedure](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification), you can replace
the `-s` flag by `-a` flag of the git tag command to only annotate the tag without signing. If you are using a newer Mac and hit an error like "gpg failed to sign the data fatal: failed to write commit object," see [this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39494631/gpg-failed-to-sign-the-data-fatal-failed-to-write-commit-object-git-2-10-0/40066889#40066889) for assistance.

Once a tag is created, an automated release process for this tag is triggered via Github Actions. This automated process includes:
- Publishing new versions of the UI libraries to npm.
- Building new go binaries and docker images.
- Publishing the docker images to Docker Hub.
- Creating a new Github release that uses the changelog as the release notes and provides tarballs with the latest go binaries.

Please verify that the Github Actions complete successfully. Once they are completed, check that everything looks good in the new Github Release. If you realize we need to adjust something in the release notes, you can edit it directly in the Github UI.

### 3. Merge the release into `main`

It can be helpful to leave the release branch up for a little while in case we need to create a patch release to address bugs or minor issues with the release you just made.

Once the release branch is no longer needed, you should open a new PR based on `main` to merge those changes. When this PR is approved, merge it into `main` using the "merge pull request" option (using "squash and merge" will lose the commit needed for the release tag, which can lead to problems).

## How to cut a UI snapshot release

Occasionally, it is helpful to test a packaged version of the UI to validate specific functionality before cutting a
real release. Where there are difficulties doing this via tools like `npm link` and `npm pack` because of complexities
with workspaces, a maintainer can create a "snapshot" release of the UI.

### Limits of snapshot releases

- **DO NOT** merge snapshot branches into `main`. They are intended only as a tool for testing.
- **DO NOT** recommend using snapshot branches in production code. They are intended to be ephemeral for testing
  purposes.

### Creating a snapshot branch

The creation of snapshots is automated by Github actions based on branch naming schemes.

- Create a branch following the naming scheme `snapshot/tag-name` (e.g. `snapshot/theme-updates`) with the changes you
  want to test. The `tag-name` should be short and kebab-case because it will be used as part of a version name and tag
  name in npm.
- Github actions will build the UI and release a version named `0.0.0-snapshot-tag-name-SHA` at a tag
  named `snapshot-tag-name` where `tag-name` comes from your branch name and `SHA` is a short version of the git sha for
  the latest commit on the branch.
  - We use `0.0.0` as the version prefix to keep snapshots at the bottom of the npm versions UI to avoid confusion for
    consumers of the package. This also helps differentiate snapshots from the concept of prereleases, which we do not
    currently provide, but may add in the future.
- Github actions will release a new version with the latest sha each time you push to the snapshot branch.

### Using a snapshot branch

- Install the snapshot branch for all relevant packages using the `snapshot-NAME` tag (
  e.g. `npm install --save-exact @perses-dev/core@snapshot-theme-updates`). Recommend using `--save-exact` to avoid
  inconsistencies with how snapshot version names may match using `^`.

### Removing a snapshot

- Delete the branch.
- Github actions will automatically remove the tag from npm. The version will still show up in the "version history"
  section of npm.
