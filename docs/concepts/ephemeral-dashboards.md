# Ephemeral Dashboard

## What it is

An ephemeral dashboard is a standalone dashboard with a time-to-live (TTL), which is why it's referred to as 'ephemeral'.

Using this feature, a user can create a real, but temporary, dashboard, that can be shared with others and will be automatically removed from the database, after a specified period.

## Why you might need it

The Ephemeral Dashboard resource addresses the need of generating preview dashboards when working with [Dashboard-as-Code](../dac/introduction.md). 


## How it can be used
### In the CLI:
The ephemeral dashboard was introduced with the continuous integration use-case in mind, hence why it integrates with [percli](../cli.md).

```bash
$ percli dac preview -h

Creates ephemeral dashboard(s) based on the dashboard(s) built locally. As a response it provides a list with the URL of each dashboard preview generated.

Usage:

 $ percli dac preview (-f [FILENAME] | -d [DIRECTORY_NAME]) [flags]

Examples:

$ percli dac preview -d ./build
```
It's thus also integrated in the [standard workflow for Dashboard-as-Code](https://github.com/perses/cli-actions/blob/main/README.md#dac) since it relies on percli.

### In the Perses UI:
When duplicating a dashboard in the Perses UI, you have the possibility to make it ephemeral by providing a time-to-live(TTL):

When a project contains ephemeral dashboards, a new dedicated tab appears in the project view:
