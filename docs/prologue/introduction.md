## Perses project goals

The project has guiding goals for its development:

1. Become an open standard dashboard visualization tool

   - have well defined dashboard definition model

   - GitOps compatible for dashboard-as-code workflows

   - Perses runs locally, edit dashboard JSON file in Git

2. Provide embeddable charts and dashboards in any user interface

   - provide different NPM packages

   - example usage could be to improve graph display in Prometheus (or embed)

3. Target Kubernetes (k8s) native mode

   - dashboard defs deployed into & read from app namespaces (CRDs)

4. Provide complete static validation for CI/CD pipelines

   - Provide command line client: percli
