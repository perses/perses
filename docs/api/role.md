# Role

A `Role` defines a set of permissions within a particular project. When you create a `Role` you need to specify the project it belongs in.
`GlobalRole`, by contrast, is not limited to a project scope.

## Choose a scope

There are two different scopes in which you can define a Role, depending on how much you want it to be shared.

- for global scope, use `GlobalRole`
- for project scope, use `Role`

### Project level

In case you would like to set permissions at Project level, you will need to create a `Role`.

```yaml
  kind: "Role"
  metadata:
    name: <string>
    project: <string>
  spec: <role_spec>
```

### Global level

In case you would like to set permissions at Global level , you will need to create a `GlobalRole`.

```yaml
  kind: "GlobalRole"
  metadata:
    name: <string>
  spec: <role_spec>
```

## Role specification

```yaml
  # List of permissions owned by the role
  permissions:
    - <permission_spec>
```

### `<permission_spec>`

```yaml
  # Types of actions the permission grant access
  actions:
    - <enum= "create" | "read" | "update" | "delete">

  # The list of kind targeted by the permission. For example: `Datasource`, `Dashboard`, ...
  # With Role, you can't target global kinds
  scopes:
    - <string>
```
