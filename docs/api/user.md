# User

For the moment, user is a way to create an account and then get a write access to a project you created.

## User Specification

```yaml
kind: "User"
metadata:
  # User name for login
  name: <string>
spec:
  [ firstName: <string> ]
  [ lastName: <string> ]

  # Password when provided is hashed and salted before going to the database
  # Password is optional because depending on the Perses configuration, you might be able to login with external
  # authentication provider or not be able to create a user at all.
  # It can happen when the Perses server relies on a ldap database for authentication.
  [ nativeProvider: [ password: <string>]] 

  # Save the context of the oauth provider used if the user has been created from an external OIDC or OAuth
  # authentication provider.
  oauthProviders:  
  - [ <OAuth Provider specification> ]
