// routerMiddleware is here to serve properly the react app.
//
// As React is creating a single page application, it embeds its own router, which allows you to navigate in the UI without reloading it.
// For example, if you run the UI separately (with npm start), you will be able to access a dashboard using the URL http://localhost:3000/projects/perses/dashboards/<name>.
// But this is not working anymore when the UI is embedded in the binary, because then the echo router has no idea that the route /projects/:projectID/* is a React Route.
//
// Another problem that comes when you want to embed a UI in a binary is to be able to serve every single static file.
// The package embed is tackling this issue. But as a side effect, we are not able to know exactly how many static files it is serving,
// which is an issue because then how can we know if the request is an internal route of the React app, or is a request to get a static file.
//
// The dummy idea is to provide a list of react route prefixes here. If the URL path is matching one of the prefix, then the request is returning the index.html,
// because it's an internal React Route and we need to let the React app manage it.
// If the URL Path doesn't match one of the prefix, then it should be a static file that needs to be served. So we just rely on `contentHandler` that is serving the static file.
//
// In case the URL path is actually prefixed by /api/v1, then it's a request to the backend, and we can thanks the echo Router that relies on the following routing
// strategy: if the URL path is matching the less generic route registered, then use this one, otherwise use the previous route that is a bit more generic and so on.
//
// E.g for the following routes :
// 1. /api/v1/projects/perses/dashboards/*
// 2. /api/v1/projects/*
// 3. /api/v1/*
// Then:
// - /api/v1/projects/perses/dashboards/* will be served by the first route
// - /api/v1/projects/test will be served by the second route
// - /api/v1/foo will be served by the last route.
