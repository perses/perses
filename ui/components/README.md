# Perses Components Package

This [package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@perses-dev/components) includes individual components used in the Perses app and plugins. These components are broken up in a way that allows embedding in separate applications outside of Perses. For more info about corresponding packages see the [general UI README here](https://github.com/perses/perses/blob/main/ui/README.md) and markdown files in each component folder.

## Usage

To import components from the components package use the syntax below:

```typescript
import { LineChart } from "@perses-dev/components";
```

For detailed examples of how to use certain components, see individual docs for:

- [LineChart.md](./src/LineChart/LineChart.md)
- [GaugeChart.md](./src/GaugeChart/GaugeChart.md)
- [StatChart.md](./src/StatChart/StatChart.md)
