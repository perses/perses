This package gathers additional constraints corresponding to the Perses Go datamodel but that the CUE conversion misses in the current state. This should no longer be needed at some point hopefully, but for the moment the Perses model doesn't get fully converted to CUE defs because of a technical limitation in the CUE translation process: a top-value (= "any") gets generated instead of a proper def for any type that defines a custom UnmarshallJSON or UnmarshallYAML. See https://github.com/cue-lang/cue/issues/2466.

The patches defined here are automatically merged with the definitions coming from the `gen` folder - generated when running `cue get go github.com/perses/perses/pkg/model/api/v1`, which solves the gap. To learn more about this feature of CUE please refer to the [official documentation](https://cuelang.org/docs/concepts/packages/#the-cuemod-directory).
